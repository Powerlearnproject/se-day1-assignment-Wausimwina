Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building and maintaining software in a well structured and efficient way using code.
some importances of software engineering include;
1. It improves business operations
2. It expands career opportunities
3. it fosters global connectivity
4. it improves data security
5. Fosters technological advancements

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of early programming languages like Fortran and COBOL which made software development more accesible.
2. The emergence of object-oriented programming which made software more reusable
3. The shift to Agile methodologies from rigid waterfall method 


 List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning – Defining the project goals, structure 
2. Requirements Analysis – Gathering all the requirements including customers specifications to ensure the software meets expectations.
3. Design – Create blueprint of the software, user interfaces, and database structures to define how the system will work.
4. Implementation– This now involvesd coming up with an actual code to match the design specifications.
5. Testing – The software is tested for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues to ensure it functions correctly.
6. Deployment – The software is released for users, either in phases or as a full rollout.
7. Maintenance & Updates – Fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features based on user feedback.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall methodology
Rigid and structured – changes are hard to make once development starts.
Customer involvement is minimal – they only see the product at the end.
Takes longer to deliver – the full product is released only after all phases are completed.
Thorough documentation – detailed planning and requirements are set before coding begins.
Best for projects with clear, fixed requirements, like banking systems, government software, or medical applications.

Agile Methodology
it is highly adaptable – changes can be made at any stage based on feedback.
Continuous customer involvement – feedback is gathered throughout development.
Faster delivery – small, functional versions of the product are released regularly.
Minimal documentation – focus is on working software rather than paperwork.
Best for projects with evolving requirements, like mobile apps, websites, and startup products.
When to Use Each

Examples of scenarions to use waterfall, is when the working with a project that has has clear requirements, strict regulations, or minimal expected changes, for example a hospital record systems and ATM software.
Agile can be used  when the requirements may change, and quick updates are needed mostly in e-commerce websites and social media platforms.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
